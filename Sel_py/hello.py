#print "hello World"

# is used for comments
# Python is interpreted language means its does not have to compile before running it.
# Literal Constants - 3. 5.28, "this is literal constant" are literals because we are using its value literally as it is.
# print always print with new line. In order to avoid this, end statement with,

# Numbers - two types Integer and Float.
# String - sequence of characters. We can use single , double and triple quote in strings. Single and double quote work same way and we use triple quote for multiple lines.
# print "this is first line" \
"this is second line"
# print '''This is first line.
# This is second.'''

#format() method is use when we want to construct string from other information.
name = "Archana Patel"
age = 32
print "My name is {0} and age is {1}".format(name,age)
print "My name is {}.". format(name)
print "My age is {age}.".format(age=36)
print " 1/3 is {0:.3f}".format(1.0/3)

# raw string is specified with r or R, we will specify string r when there is no special processing for escape sequences
print r"this is \n new line"

#Variables are part of computer's memory to stor data

#Identifier is nothing but name given to odentify something. there are rules which we need to follow while giving name
#Name should start wiht lower/upper alphabet or an underscore. thereafter you can use numbers, aphabets and they are case sensitive

# Datatypes Variables can hold values of different types. Main are Numbers and Strings

# Python is strictly object oriented language, everything in Python is Object including Number and String datayoes

# Physical and logical line: Physical line is what we see while coding and logical line is what python sees while running.
# if we want to specify more logical line in a single physical line indicate it with ; after each physical line

i=5; print i;

# Block : set os similar statements together is call block.
